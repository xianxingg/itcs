					Pinyan Lu is interested in theoretical computer science, including complexity
theory, algorithms design and algorithmic game theory. He made breakthrough
contribution in holographic algorithms, dichotomy theorem for counting problems,
approximate counting algorithms, optimal competitive auctions, auctions with
budgets, pricing and auction for market with externality, and so on.   Currently,
his research is mainly focused on complexity and approximability of counting
problems, and algorithmic mechanism design. This proposal is to resolve some
fundamental open problems in these areas.

The Institute of Theoretical Computer Science is a newly established academic unit at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics(SUFE),aimed at creating a world-class environment for research in broad areas of theoretical computer science. Current research interests involve Algorithms and Complexity,Algorithmic Game Theory,Machine Learning,Information Theory.

<br />

To classify computational problems in terms of their computational difficulty is the fundamental question in computer science, the implications of which go well beyond computing to all engineering disciplines and to the entire society. In this direction, the research of INS is aiming for dichotomy theorems for certain computational frameworks. That is to say, to give a characterization: If certain conditions are satisfied, the problem is polynomial time computable; otherwise, it is hard.
</p><p style="margin-top: 15px; "><strong style="color: #ae1831; font-size: 14px;">Computational Economics</strong>
<br />

Computational Economics has emerged as an important interdisciplinary research area between economics and computer science. There are two types of questions in this interdisciplinary research area: To study some economics solution concepts from computational perspective, such as the computational complexity of Nash Equilibrium; and to study some traditional optimization problems taking into the account the rational behavior of agents involved in the problems. INS is involved in both research directions.
