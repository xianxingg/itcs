				Computational Economics has emerged as an important interdisciplinary research area between economics and computer science. There are two types of questions in this interdisciplinary research area: To study some economics solution concepts from computational perspective, such as the computational complexity of Nash Equilibrium; and to study some traditional optimization problems taking into the account the rational behavior of agents involved in the problems. INS is involved in both research directions.
